Artificial intelligence refers to computer systems that can perform complex tasks normally done by human-reasoning, decision making, creating, etc.

There is no single, simple definition of artificial intelligence because AI tools are capable of a wide range of tasks and outputs, but NASA follows the definition of AI found within EO 13960, which references Section 238(g) of the National Defense Authorization Act of 2019.

How Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning Fit Together

AI tools used at NASA sometimes use machine learning, which uses data and algorithms to train computers to make classifications, generate predictions, or uncover similarities or trends across large datasets.

Some common methods used at NASA include:

Complex processes require tools to consider imperfect or unknown situations. This method of artificial intelligence considers multiple outcomes and probabilities to inform decisions.

A subset of machine learning that involves neural networks with many layers. It distinguishes itself from other forms of neural networks primarily through its capability to learn features automatically from data.

A subset of machine learning that trains computers to understand, interpret, and manipulate human language.

A method to train computers to process data in a way thatâ€™s inspired by the human brain, using a layered, interconnected neuron-inspired structure.

NASA explores the unknown in air and space, innovates for the benefit of humanity, and inspires the world through discovery.
