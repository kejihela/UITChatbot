Artificial intelligence is a broad field with many interconnected terms and concepts, and is often used as a catch-all word to mean any type of smart machine. In reality, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and deep learning are distinct terms with subtle differences.

Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks to process and analyze information. Neural networks are composed of computational nodes that are layered within deep learning algorithms. Each layer contains an input layer, an output layer, and a hidden layer. The neural network is fed training data which helps the algorithm learn and improve accuracy. When a neural network contains multiple hidden layers in addition to its input and output layers, it's considered a deep neural network, which is the foundation of deep learning.

Deep learning algorithms are inspired by the workings of the human brain and are particularly powerful for analyzing large amounts of unstructured data. It’s used in many of the tasks we think of as AI today, including image and speech recognition, object detection, and natural language processing. Deep learning can make non-linear, complex correlations within datasets though requires more training data and computational resources than machine learning.

Some common types of neural networks used for deep learning include:

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables a system to autonomously learn and improve without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning algorithms work by recognizing patterns and data and making predictions when new data is inputted into the system.

Several different models are typically used in machine learning, including:

Supervised learning is a machine learning model that uses labeled training data (structured data) to map a specific input to an output. In supervised learning, the output is known (such as recognizing a picture of an apple) and the model is trained on data of the known output. In simple terms, to train the algorithm to recognize pictures of apples, feed it pictures labeled as apples.

The most common supervised learning algorithms used today include:

Unsupervised learning is a machine learning model that uses unlabeled data (unstructured data) to learn patterns. Unlike supervised learning, the output is not known ahead of time. Rather, the algorithm learns from the data without human input (thus, unsupervised) and categorizes it into groups based on attributes.

The most common unsupervised learning algorithms used today include:

A mixed approach machine learning called semi-supervised learning is also often employed, where only some of the data is labeled. In semi-supervised learning, the algorithm must figure out how to organize and structure the data to achieve a known result. For instance, the machine learning model is told that the end result is an apple, but only some of the training data is labeled as an apple.

Reinforcement learning is a machine learning model that can be described as “learn by doing” through a series of trial and error experiments. An “agent” learns to perform a defined task through a feedback loop until its performance is within a desirable range. The agent receives positive reinforcement when it performs the task well and negative reinforcement when it performs poorly.

Artificial intelligence is a field of science concerned with building computers and machines that can reason, learn, and act in such a way that would normally require human intelligence or that involves data whose scale exceeds what humans can analyze. AI is a large field that includes many disciplines including computer science, data and analytics, software engineering, and even philosophy.

At the business level, AI is a set of technologies that has many use cases, including data analytics, predictions and forecasting, natural language processing, recommendations, machine automation, intelligent data retrieval, and more.

While these terms are related, they represent a clear hierarchy: deep learning is a specialized type of machine learning, and machine learning is a core discipline within the broader field of artificial intelligence. The primary distinction comes down to capability, complexity, and feature engineering.

Feature

Artificial intelligence

Machine learning

Deep learning

Scope and definition

Broadest concept. Field dedicated to creating systems or machines that can perform tasks typically requiring human intelligence (Example: reasoning, problem-solving, learning, perception).

A subset of AI. Focuses on developing systems that can learn from and make decisions based on data, without being explicitly programmed for every scenario.

A subset of ML. Uses multi-layered Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) to learn complex patterns and hierarchical representations directly from large amounts of raw data.

Goal

To simulate or replicate human intelligence in machines.

To enable machines to learn from data to perform specific tasks accurately.

To achieve higher accuracy and handle more complex patterns (especially in unstructured data) by automatically learning features from data using deep neural networks.

Approach

Can use various techniques: logic, rule-based systems, search algorithms, optimization, and - perhaps most importantly - machine learning and deep learning.

Uses algorithms (Example: Linear Regression, SVM, Decision Trees, Random Forests) to parse data, learn from it, and make informed decisions or predictions.

Uses complex, multi-layered Artificial Neural Networks (inspired by the human brain's structure) with many parameters.

Data requirements

Varies greatly. Rule-based AI might need little data, while AI relying on ML/DL needs significant data.

Requires significant amounts of structured or labeled data for training algorithms effectively. Performance generally improves with more data.

Requires very large datasets (often millions of data points) to train the deep networks effectively. Performance is heavily dependent on data scale.

Hardware requirements

Varies. Simple AI can run on basic hardware.

Can often run on standard CPUs, though complex models benefit from more computational power.

Typically requires high-performance computing, especially GPUs or TPUs, for efficient training due to massive parallel computations.

Feature engineering

Depends on the method used.

Often requires significant manual feature engineering. Humans need to select, transform, and create relevant input features from the raw data to help the algorithm learn.

Performs automatic feature extraction. The network learns the relevant features hierarchically through its layers directly from the raw data, reducing the need for manual feature engineering.

Training time

N/A for non-learning AI. Varies greatly for ML/DL-based AI.

Can range from seconds to hours, generally faster than DL for tasks where ML is suitable.

Often requires very long training times (hours, days, or even weeks) due to large datasets and complex network architectures.

Interpretability

Varies. Rule-based systems can be highly interpretable. AI using complex ML/DL can be difficult to interpret.

Varies. Simpler models (Example: Decision Trees, Linear Regression) are relatively more interpretable. Complex models (Example: ensemble methods) may be less so.

Often lacking transparency. Understanding why a deep learning model made a specific decision can be challenging due to the complexity and quantity of parameters.

Key use cases and examples

Expert systems, chess-playing programs, general problem solvers, overarching concepts for virtual assistants and self-driving cars.

Recommendation systems in ecommerce or streaming services, spam filtering, predictive maintenance, medical diagnosis from structured data, customer churn prediction.

Image recognition (tagging photos), natural language processing (translation, sentiment analysis), speech recognition (voice assistants), autonomous vehicle perception systems, advanced medical image analysis.
